# Fashion Product Classification 
**for slash AI internship**

I used a public dataset similar to what the problem that was gave to me which is fashion product images classification, There's many approaches I can solve this problem with but I decided to go with (CNN) as they can learn and extract features from raw pixel data without any preprocessing or feature engineering.

## Appendix

In this project I demonstrated some key AI/ML/DL techniques in preprocessing, data visualization, data preperation and model building, validating and testing.
And here are some screenshots from the projects insights over the data. I'll be providing a link to the dataset and to the kaggle notebook as the dataset is over 25 GB.

## Documentation

The model is a sequential model from tensorflow framework the model is trained over a aproximatlly 38k images over a course of 20 epochs which showed the improvment of the model by the epoch.

All the images have gone through preprocessing and visualized and revised several time all faulty images are removed.
